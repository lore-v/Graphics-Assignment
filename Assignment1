1. Convert an Applet coordinate into standard Cartesian coordinate.
2. Based on Cartesian coordinate (in Question1) construct a square grid (Fig.1) with origin (0,0) at the
centre of screen. Use (a, b, c) as background colour and (m, n, p) as grid colour where values of a, b, c,
m, n, p are set by the programmer. Draw X axis and Y axis with colour other than background colour.
Include zoom -in or zoom-out facility. In this figure, a point is shown using square. Circle may be used
alternatively instead of square. Keep size of the square/circle as variable and find the most suitable size
based on eye estimation.

3. Develop a method plotpoint (x, y, C) to check if any point (x, y) can be plotted on the grid at
appropriate position with colour C. Hence, draw basic shapes (line, square etc.) on the constructed grid
by calling plotpoint() only.
